# Novel Explainable Feature Extraction from 3D-Images applied on Pneumonia Detection.

In this work, we propose a novel explainable feature extraction and prediction framework applied in 3D-Image Pneumonia detection. In particular, we propose a new set of explainable features based on well-known mathematical and geometric concepts such as number of lines, vertices, contours, and area size of objects. These features are calculated based on the extracted contours of every 3D-input image slice. Feeding these features into a common white box (WB) ML model the outcome is a totally explainable and transparent prediction model. In order to further validate the generalization efficiency of the proposed approach, we experimented also on a totally different application domain, namely the Deepfake detection. Based on our experimental results, the proposed framework outperformed all other state of the art black box approaches revealing the efficacy of the proposed methodology.
